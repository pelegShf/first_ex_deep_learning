part 5 answers:
1. yes. the accuracy depend on the architecture and the hyperparameters. Tuning them could lead to better accuracy
2. Both the log-linear model and the MLP dont exceed 60-70 accuracy with the unigrams feature set in our experiments
3. Our MLP solve the xor function. in our configuration it takes about 30 iterations.
