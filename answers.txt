1. We got about the same accuracy with both models, around ~85%.
    sometimes the log-linear model even provides better(very slightly, 1~2%) results.
    suggests that in this case, the data is somehow linearly separable and MLP is unnecessary.
    we chose log-linear since it is simpler and runs faster.

2. Both the log-linear model and the MLP dont exceed 60%-65% accuracy with the unigrams feature set in our experiments.
    We can easily see that the bigrams feature set is much better

3. Our MLP solve the xor function. in our configuration it takes about 12 iterations.
